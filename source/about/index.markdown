My name is Andrii Soldatenko and I like testing and programming. I'm working as Lead QA Automation Engineer in [Wargamming.NET](http://wargaming.net). Also I'm working as Python backend developer via [toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#connect-fantastic-computer-engineers) under social network.

I boast expertise as a Python and Ruby developer with strong hard and soft skills. I have deep knowledge of automated-testing and really understands how to assess and improve project quality. I like to solve difficult tasks, algorithms and take part in sport programming competitions.
